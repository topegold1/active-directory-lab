# Domain Controller Deployment

## Objective

Deploy a Windows Server as an Active Directory Domain Controller to simulate an enterprise identity infrastructure.

---

## Server Configuration

Installed Active Directory Domain Services role:

```
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
```

Promoted server to domain controller:

```
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName teekay.local
```

Server rebooted after promotion.

---

## Network Configuration

Static IP configured:

```
IP Address: 192.168.56.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: (not required for internal lab)
DNS Server: 127.0.0.1
```

---

## Verification

Confirm domain membership:

```
(Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain
```

Result:

```
teekay.local
```

DNS resolution test:

```
nslookup teekay.local
```

Result resolves to domain controller IP address.

---

## Security Relevance

Active Directory is the central authentication system in most organizations.
Attackers target domain controllers because gaining control of AD allows privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence across the entire network.

This server now acts as the identity authority for the lab environment.
